Ubuntu Bionic Notes

20180114
lvm the first time was OK in virtualbox.
after troubles I tried to reinstall quickly. grub-install failed so I fell back to ext4

after installing some packages, one of them prevented gdm from starting up.
it might have been that vmware proprietary driver.
so I quickly reinstalled again, bummer!

This time seems ok. both monitors are recognized.
My upgraded 16.04 machine isn't so lucky. I would like to compare them soon.
This freshly installed 18.04 pre-release is doing well so far.
